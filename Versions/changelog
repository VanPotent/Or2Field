Fixes from 0.3.0 to 0.3.1:

Replaced naïve ["'].*?["'] title/content regex with (['"])(.*?)\1 so we only stop on the matching quote.
Pulled out the inner text, escaped any " characters, and always wrapped it in a valid Lua double‑quoted string.
Unified Image handling to accept:
rbxassetid://… → numeric ID
quoted icon names → wrapped in "
unquoted numbers → left as-is
Renamed Time = … to Duration = … for Rayfield’s API.
Simplified the Python code to eliminate nested backslashes and avoid string literal syntax errors.


Fixes from 0.2 to 0.3:
Changed the deletion loop in deleteSpecificObjects() to use game.Workspace:GetDescendants() instead of game:GetDescendants(). This prevents UI elements (like those within CoreGui or other non-workspace objects) from being inadvertently destroyed.

Improvements
Robust Object Deletion: The functions now only remove objects from the Workspace, ensuring that UI or other game elements remain intact.



Fixes from 0.1 -0.2:

Fixed paragraph conversion to support multi-line strings using [[ ... ]] Lua syntax.

Corrected regex logic to match both single-line ("...", '...') and multi-line ([[...]]) content in AddParagraph.

Improvements
Enhanced paragraph conversion to output Tab:CreateParagraph({ Title = ..., Content = ... }) format correctly.

Applied re.DOTALL to allow paragraph content matching across multiple lines.

Internal
Refactored regex handling for more accurate and universal Lua string detection in paragraph conversions.

Fixes from 0.1 -0.2:

Fixed paragraph conversion to support multi-line strings using [[ ... ]] Lua syntax.

Corrected regex logic to match both single-line ("...", '...') and multi-line ([[...]]) content in AddParagraph.

Improvements
Enhanced paragraph conversion to output Tab:CreateParagraph({ Title = ..., Content = ... }) format correctly.

Applied re.DOTALL to allow paragraph content matching across multiple lines.

Internal
Refactored regex handling for more accurate and universal Lua string detection in paragraph conversions.

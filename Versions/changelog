Fixes from 0.2 to 0.3:

Changed the deletion loop in deleteSpecificObjects() to use game.Workspace:GetDescendants() instead of game:GetDescendants(). This prevents UI elements (like those within CoreGui or other non-workspace objects) from being inadvertently destroyed.

Improvements
Robust Object Deletion: The functions now only remove objects from the Workspace, ensuring that UI or other game elements remain intact.



Fixes from 0.1 -0.2:

Fixed paragraph conversion to support multi-line strings using [[ ... ]] Lua syntax.

Corrected regex logic to match both single-line ("...", '...') and multi-line ([[...]]) content in AddParagraph.

Improvements
Enhanced paragraph conversion to output Tab:CreateParagraph({ Title = ..., Content = ... }) format correctly.

Applied re.DOTALL to allow paragraph content matching across multiple lines.

Internal
Refactored regex handling for more accurate and universal Lua string detection in paragraph conversions.
